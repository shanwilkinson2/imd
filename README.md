# imd
Makes a leaflet map showing:
* Greater Manchester Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) that are in the top/ bottom 10% of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 
* Semi transparent so can see changes
* Over the last 3 IMDs - 2019, 2015, 2010
* Uses appropriate boundaries for the year (changes between 2010/ 2015)
* Note: boundary links don't work, done on pre-downloaded data

TO DO - change so boundaries download off OS open geography
